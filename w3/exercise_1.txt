-- The query profile showed that the only area causing significant processing time is 
-- when the session_length is being calculated and averaged. In order to keep the query 
-- efficient, I kept the data asks as separate CTEs to minimize joins. The final join 
-- combining all the data is at the event_date level, which is scalable with any number 
-- of events, and only becomes less efficient with significant days past.
